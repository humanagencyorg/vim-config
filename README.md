# Vim Config

This is a basic Vim setup that can be used to get you started using the tool.

## Instructions

1. Download your color scheme.  [tomorrow-theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) (moved [here](git@github.com:chriskempson/base16.git)) is a great collection of color schemes.  The [Tomorrow Night Eighties](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme/blob/master/OS%20X%20Terminal/Tomorrow%20Night%20Eighties.terminal) is my personal favorite.

2. Setup your `.vimrc`.  Here is an example [`.vimrc`]() that sets up basic ruby plugins, line indents, etc.

3. Restart any open Vim instances for the changes to take affect.

## Reference

### Plugins

Plugins allow you to add extra functionality to Vim.  You typically will use a plugin manager to add these add / remove these plugins. Most of these allow you to clone the plugin into your `.vim` directory.  Here are a few popular plugin managers and plugins: 

* [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) - very popular plugin manager

### TMUX Integration
If you like, you can run your tests in a separate TMUX pane.  When you initially run your tests, you will be prompted to choose what pane you would like to see the test results in.

By pressing `prefix q` (with `prefix` being your TMUX leader key), you can see the numbers on each pane.
